This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or a prop before it has been assigned a value. This is especially common when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API or using setTimeout.  Here is an example: 
```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
In this code, the component tries to render `this.state.data.name` before `this.state.data` is populated by the API call. This will result in a runtime error because `this.state.data` is initially null.
